# qwerty
a strange productivity tool, right in the terminal
> the name `qwerty` comes from the simple fact that it is an easy sequence of letters to type and remember, and as such is the entry point for any commands 

## Origin Story 
As a developer, my terminal is always open. I wanted a centralized application to perform various tasks, and a CLI felt like a natural fit. This project is still in its genesis and most features are incomplete.

### Features 
- Create todo lists :white_check_mark:
- Utilize AES to encrypt all data end to end :white_check_mark:
- Create periodic tasks and reminders [in progress]
- Create a direct messaging service [in progress]
- Add ability to compose and send a Tweet [in progress]

### Proposed Features
- Slack Integration
- Brain games/puzzles
- Add the ability to download new features - ie the base application would be rather minimal, and a package manager could be used to install additional functionality as desired


These features may seem sporadic and unrelated, but I started making this for my own enjoyment, and each feature added is something that I found myself wanting to do from the terminal.

If you have any ideas or feature requests, please contact me or submit a Github ticket! Eventually this will be 'production-ready' and intended to be used by anyone who regularly has an open terminal window.
